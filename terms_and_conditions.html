    other than its intended purpose. Procedure of Trading Operations Execution
    Trading Operations include arbitrage operations for sale and purchase of
    trade contracts with the trading instruments provided by the Company. These
    operations are executed via the Trading Terminal provided by the Company
    within the Client’s Area. The processing of all Clients Trading Operations
    is carried out by the Company using the Trading Server at its disposal with
    the appropriate software. The Company provides quotes in the Trading
    Terminal, indicating the price in a single Plost quote, which is calculated
    by the formula: Plost = Pbid + (Pask-Pbid)/2 Where: Plost - the price that
    is used for executing Trading Operations and transactions that take place
    for opening and closing trade contracts. Pbid - the Bid price provided to
    the Company by its liquidity providers. Pask - the Ask price provided to the
    Company by its liquidity providers. Trading on the Company’s Trading Server
    is also performed at the price of Plost. The Company allows Trading
    Operations and quotes around the clock. The Company uses the «Market
    Execution» quotation technology for the Trading Operations execution and
    performs a transaction at the price that exists at the time of the Client’s
    request processing in the queue of Client’s requests on the Company’s
    Trading Server. The maximum deviation of the price indicated in the Client’s
    Trading Terminal from the price existing on the Company’s Trading Server
    does not exceed the value of the two average spreads for this trading
    instrument in the periods corresponding to the average volatility of this
    instrument. The Company reserves the right to refuse the Client to conduct a
    Trade Operation if, at the moment of placing a contract request, the Company
    does not have enough liquidity in the chosen trading instrument by the time
    the contract expires. In this case, upon clicking the corresponding button
    in the Trading Terminal, the Client receives a notification. The amount of
    funds paid to the Client in the event of a positive outcome of the trade
    contract concluded by him/her is determined by the Company as a percentage
    of the amount of collateral determined by the Client at the time of the
    execution of the trade contract using the corresponding interface element of
    the Trading Terminal. As a part of services provided by the Company, Client
    is offered to purchase, sell trade contracts or not to participate in
    operations. The trade contracts come in a variety of classes, depending on
    the purchase method. The Client has the possibility to keep any number of
    simultaneously opened Trading Operations on his Trading Account for any
    expiration date of any class of trade contracts available. At the same time,
    the total volume of all newly opened Trading Operations cannot exceed the
    amount of the Client’s balance in the Trading Terminal. The Company
    implements the following mandatory mechanisms for conducting Trading
    Operations with CFD contracts of the «High - Low» class: The Client, using
    the Trading Terminal provided inside of the Client’s Area, determines the
    parameters of a Trading Operation: a trading instrument, a contract
    expiration time, a transaction volume, a contract type («Call» or «Put»).
    The price displayed in the Client’s Trading Terminal is a Plost price.
    Depending on the liquidity volumes presently existing at the liquidity
    providers, the yield of a trade contract as a percentage in case of its
    positive execution is determined by the trading instrument chosen by the
    Client in the Client’s Trading Terminal. The level of profitability is
    determined for each specific Trading Operation and is displayed in the
    corresponding interface of the Client’s Trading Terminal. When the Client
    clicks the «Call» or «Put» button in the Trading Terminal, the parameters of
    the Trading Operation defined by the Client are fixed and transferred to the
    Company’s Trading Server. The Trading Server receives a request from the
    Client’s Trading Terminal and puts it in a queue for processing. At this
    point, the Client’s Trading Account records the amount of collateral for the
    execution of a trade contract in accordance with the amount set by the
    Client. At the moment of occurrence of the queue for processing the Client’s
    request, the Trading Server reads the main parameters of the Trade
    Operation, carries out the production of the operation itself at the price
    that currently exists on the Company’s Server with a record of this
    operation in the server database. Processing of Trade Operations, thus, is
    carried out by the «Market execution» technology. The processing time for
    Client's request depends on the quality of the connection between the
    Client`s Trading Terminal and the Trading Server as well as on the current
    market for the asset. Under normal market conditions, a Client`s request is
    typically processed within 0 – 4 seconds. Under abnormal market conditions
    the processing time may be increased. At the time of the trade contract
    expiration, the price at which the entry into the contract was made is
    compared with the closing price. Onwards, the following algorithm is used:
    For a «Call» type contract: - if the closing price of the contract exceeds
    the opening price of the contract (in a strict compliance, Popening <
    Pclosing), then such contract is considered to be executed. The fixed margin
    amount and the payout for the execution of this trade contract are
    transferred to the Client’s Trading Account in accordance with the value
    indicated in the Client’s Trading Terminal at the moment when he/she uses
    the «Call» button. - if the closing price of the contract is less than the
    opening price of the contract (in a strict compliance, Popening > Pclosing),
    then such contract is considered unfulfilled. A withdrawal of a fixed margin
    amount from the Client’s Trading Account is initiated. For a «Put» type
    contract: - if the closing price of this contract is less than the opening
    price of the contract (in a strict compliance, Popening > Pclosing), then
    such contract is considered to be executed. The fixed margin amount and the
    payout for the execution of this trade contract are transferred to the
    Client’s Trading Account in accordance with the value indicated in the
    Client’s Trading Terminal at the moment when he/she uses the «Put» button. -
    if the closing price of the contract is more than the opening price of the
    contract (in a strict compliance, Popening < Pclosing), then such contract
    is considered unfulfilled. There is a withdrawal from the Client’s Trading
    Account of the fixed margin amount. The Company reserves the right to cancel
    or revise the results of the Client’s Trading Operation in the following
    cases: - The Trading Operation is opened/closed at a non-market quotation; -
    The Trading Operation is performed with the help of unauthorized bot
    software; - In case of software failures or other malfunction on the Trading
    Server; - Synthetic Trading Operations (locks) on trade contracts may be
    invalidated in the event of revealing obvious signs of abuse. Quotes and
    Information The price offered in the Company’s Trading Terminal is used for
    Trading Operations. Trading conditions for instruments are specified in the
    contract specifications. All issues related to determining the current price
    level in the market are in the sole competence of the Company, their values
    are the same for all Clients of the Company. In the event of an unplanned
    interruption in the flow of server quotes caused by a hardware or software
    failure, the Company reserves the right to synchronize the base of Public
    offer quotations on the Trading Server with other sources. Such sources may
    be: A. the quotes base of the liquidity provider; B. the quotes base of a
    news agency. In the event of a failure in profit calculation by the type of
    trade contract/ instrument as a result of incorrect response of the software
    and/or hardware of the Trading Server, the Company reserves the right to: A.
    Cancel a mistakenly opened position; B. Adjust a mistakenly executed Trading
    Operation according to the current values. The method of adjusting or
    changing the volume, price and/or number of Trading Operations (and/or the

    binding on the Client. The Company undertakes to inform the Client of any
